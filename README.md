# Quest Kids HTML Game

Welcome to **Quest Kids**, a simple single-page HTML game made by me! 🎮✨

## 📜 About the Game
This is my first HTML game, created entirely in one file using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It's a fun little project where you can **pop the balloon as many times as you can in 20 seconds!**  
- The balloon **moves to a new position every second**, making it tricky to catch.  
- Click it fast to get the highest score before the time runs out!

## 🛠 How It Works
- Built using **HTML only** (no external libraries)
- Works directly in any web browser
- Designed to be lightweight and fast

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Click **Start** (or open the link).
2. Pop the balloon as many times as you can within 20 seconds.
3. Try to beat your own high score!
